## üîß Installation

First of all, make sure you have Go 1.12 installed on your system.

Install the library using `go get`...

```bash
go get github.com/exybore/goweather
```

... or use whatever dependency manager you like! Then, you can start writing your code !

## ‚å® Usage

### Initializing the API

Before continuing, head over to [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org) and grab an API key. It's free up to 60 requests per minute, which is pretty comfortable.

After this step, you're ready to initialize the API using the `goweather.NewAPI` function :

```go
package main

import "github.com/exybore/goweather"

func main() {
  api, err := goweather.NewAPI("ez5e4fz44e84fg89ze8", "en", "metric")
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
}
```

This function takes three parameters :

- the API token that you generated using your account on openweathermap.org
- the language to use. It can be one of these Arabic - `ar`, Bulgarian - `bg`, Catalan - `ca`, Czech - `cz`, German - `de`, Greek - `el`, English - `en`, Persian (Farsi) - `fa`, Finnish - `fi`, French - `fr`, Galician - `gl`, Croatian - `hr`, Hungarian - `hu`, Italian - `it`, Japanese - `ja`, Korean - `kr`, Latvian - `la`, Lithuanian - `lt`, Macedonian - `mk`, Dutch - `nl`, Polish - `pl`, Portuguese - `pt`, Romanian - `ro`, Russian - `ru`, Swedish - `se`, Slovak - `sk`, Slovenian - `sl`, Spanish - `es`, Turkish - `tr`, Ukrainian - `ua`, Vietnamese - `vi`, Chinese Simplified - `zh_cn`, Chinese Traditional - `zh_tw`
- the unit system. It can be one of these :
  - `default` (temperatures in Kelvin)
  - `metric` (temperatures in Celsius)
  - `imperial` (temperatures in Fahrenheit)

### Get current weather

To get the current weather, use the `Current` method of the API :

```go
  weather, err := api.Current("Lyon,FR")
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
```

You can use any existing location in the parameter, but it's recommended to use the `City,Country code` format so the result is 100% accurate.

The method returns a `types.Current` structure that you can explore [on GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/exybore/goweather/types#Current)

### Get forecast

To get the forecast, use the `Forecast` method of the API :

```go
  weather, err := api.Forecast("Lyon,FR")
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
```

You can use any existing location in the parameter, but it's recommended to use the `City,Country code` format so the result is 100% accurate.

The method returns a `types.Forecast` structure that you can explore [on GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/exybore/goweather/types#Forecast)
